# Engineering Requirements Document: Real-time Order Tracking

## 1. Introduction

This Engineering Requirements Document (ERD) outlines the technical specifications and requirements for the development of a real-time order tracking feature for our online grocery delivery application. This feature will allow users to monitor the live location of their delivery driver and receive updated ETAs. This document is intended for the development team and stakeholders involved in the implementation of this feature.

## 2. Goals

The primary goals of this feature are to:

* Provide users with real-time visibility into the delivery process.
* Improve the accuracy of delivery time estimates.
* Reduce user anxiety and the number of "Where is my order?" support requests.
* Enable proactive communication of delivery status changes.

## 3. Scope

This project includes the development and integration of the following:

* A map-based interface within the user application to display the driver's location.
* A backend system to track driver locations and calculate ETAs.
* Push notifications to update users on significant delivery status changes.
* Secure communication channels for location data and driver information.

This project excludes:

* Offline order tracking functionality.
* Integration with third-party map applications outside of the app.
* Detailed driver navigation or route optimization features (these will be provided to the driver separately).

## 4. Functional Requirements

The system shall:

* **4.1:** Display the driver's real-time location on a map within the user application.
* **4.2:** Update the driver's location on the map at a defined interval (e.g., every 5-10 seconds).
* **4.3:** Calculate and display a dynamic Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) to the user.
* **4.4:** Update the ETA in real-time based on the driver's location, speed, and traffic conditions.
* **4.5:** Send push notifications to the user for key delivery status updates, including:
    * **4.5.1:** "Driver is on the way" (when the driver departs the store).
    * **4.5.2:** "Driver is approaching your location" (e.g., 5 minutes away).
    * **4.5.3:** "Driver has arrived."
* **4.6:** Display the driver's name and vehicle information (e.g., model, license plate) to the user.
* **4.7:** Provide a masked phone number for the user to contact the driver through the app.
* **4.8:** Store the delivery history, including the driver's route, for a defined period (e.g., 30 days).
* **4.9:** Support map zooming and scrolling to allow users to see the delivery route.
* **4.10:** Handle scenarios where the driver's GPS signal is temporarily lost (e.g., display a "Location Unavailable" message).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

* **5.1: Performance:**
    * **5.1.1:** The driver's location on the map shall update smoothly and with minimal delay (sub-second latency).
    * **5.1.2:** ETA calculations shall be performed efficiently to minimize server load.
    * **5.1.3:** Push notifications shall be delivered to users within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., within 5 seconds of the event).
* **5.2: Scalability:**
    * **5.2.1:** The system shall be able to handle a large number of concurrent active deliveries.
    * **5.2.2:** The system shall be designed to scale horizontally to accommodate future growth in order volume and user base.
* **5.3: Security:**
    * **5.3.1:** Driver location data shall be transmitted and stored securely, with appropriate encryption.
    * **5.3.2:** User and driver contact information shall be protected and masked to ensure privacy.
    * **5.3.3:** Access to location data shall be restricted to authorized users and systems.
* **5.4: Reliability:**
    * **5.4.1:** The system shall be highly available, with minimal downtime.
    * **5.4.2:** Robust error handling and fault tolerance mechanisms shall be implemented.
    * **5.4.3:** The system shall be able to recover from temporary GPS signal loss or network interruptions.
* **5.5: Usability:**
    * **5.5.1:** The map interface shall be intuitive and easy to use.
    * **5.5.2:** The ETA display shall be clear and prominent.
    * **5.5.3:** Notifications shall be informative and timely.
* **5.6: Maintainability:**
    * **5.6.1:** The system shall be designed to be modular and easy to maintain.
    * **5.6.2:** Code shall be well-documented and follow coding best practices.
    * **5.6.3:** The system shall include comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities.
* **5.7: Data Privacy:**
    * **5.7.1:** The system should comply with all relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) regarding the collection, storage, and use of location data.
    * **5.7.2:** Users shall be provided with clear and concise information about how their location data is used.
    * **5.7.3:** Users shall have the ability to control location data sharing permissions.

## 6. Technical Requirements

* **6.1: Mapping:**
    * **6.1.1:** The system shall use a mapping service (e.g., Google Maps Platform, Mapbox) to display the driver's location.
    * **6.1.2:** The mapping service shall provide accurate real-time traffic data.
* **6.2: Location Tracking:**
    * **6.2.1:** The system shall use GPS data from the driver's mobile device to track their location.
    * **6.2.2:** Location data shall be transmitted to the backend system using a secure protocol (e.g., HTTPS, WebSockets).
* **6.3: Backend:**
    * **6.3.1:** The backend system shall store driver location data in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension).
    * **6.3.2:** The backend shall calculate ETAs using an appropriate algorithm, considering distance, speed, and traffic conditions.
    * **6.3.3:** The backend shall manage communication with the user application and the driver's device.
* **6.4: Notifications:**
    * **6.4.1:** The system shall use a push notification service (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging, APNs) to send real-time updates to users.
* **6.5: APIs:**
    * **6.5.1:** The system shall provide APIs for the user application to retrieve driver location and ETA information.
    * **6.5.2:** The system shall provide APIs for the driver's device to send location updates.

## 7. Constraints

* **7.1:** The system must be compatible with existing user mobile applications (iOS and Android).
* **7.2:** The system must be designed to minimize battery consumption on the driver's mobile device.
* **7.3:** The system must comply with all relevant data privacy regulations.
* **7.4:** The project must be completed within the allocated budget and timeline.

## 8. Acceptance Criteria
