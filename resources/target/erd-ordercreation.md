# Engineering Requirements Document: Order Creation

## 1. Introduction

This Engineering Requirements Document (ERD) outlines the technical specifications and system requirements for the development of the comprehensive "Order Creation" module within our online grocery delivery application. This module will enable users to seamlessly browse for products, manage their shopping cart, proceed through an intuitive checkout process, and receive confirmation for their placed orders. This document is intended for the engineering team, product managers, QA teams, and other stakeholders involved in the design, development, and testing of this core functionality.

## 2. Goals

The primary engineering goals for the Order Creation module are to:

* Develop a robust, scalable, and performant system for users to browse products and manage their shopping carts.
* Implement a secure and reliable checkout process, integrating with necessary third-party services like payment gateways.
* Ensure data integrity for product information, inventory levels, user details, and order records.
* Provide a smooth and intuitive user experience to maximize conversion rates and minimize cart abandonment.
* Facilitate easy maintenance and future enhancements through modular design and well-defined interfaces.

## 3. Scope

This project includes the design, development, and integration of the following components and functionalities:

* **Product Discovery:** Search functionality, category Browse, filtering, and sorting.
* **Product Display:** Product listing pages and detailed product information pages.
* **Shopping Cart Management:** Adding items, removing items, updating quantities, and real-time price calculation.
* **Checkout Process:** Address selection/management, delivery slot selection, payment method integration, application of discounts/promos, and order review.
* **Order Confirmation:** Generation of order ID, display of confirmation to the user, and sending of confirmation notifications (email/SMS).
* **User Account Features:** Management of saved addresses, viewing order history, and wishlist functionality.
* **Backend Services:** APIs for product catalog, inventory, cart, user, and order management.
* **Integrations:** Payment gateways, inventory management systems, address validation services, and notification services.

This project explicitly excludes:
